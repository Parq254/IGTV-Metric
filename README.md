## Growth.<a name="Growth"></a>
Growth metrics show you the change (increase or decrease) of a metric. For example, follower growth shows how your follower count changes over time.

(Metric at Time 1 - Metric at Time 2 / Metric at Time 2) x 100 = Growth %

For example, if you ended October (Time 1) with 950 followers and had 710 followers in September (Time 2), your follower growth rate would be 33.8%.

Other Instagram metrics to track for growth: impressions, reach, engagement, clicks, and replies

## Rate.<a name="Rate"></a>
Rate metrics give you a percentage figure to help you understand a particular metric relative to another metric. For example, interaction rate is the percentage of your followers that have interacted with your post, story, or IGTV.

For posts and IGTV, Instagram analytics groups likes, comments, saves, and shares under interactions. For Instagram stories, replies and shares are considered interactions.

(Metric (e.g., number of interactions on a post) / Follower count when the post was published) x 100 = Rate %

If you have 950 followers and a post received 175 interactions, that post’s interaction rate is 18.4%.

For Instagram Stories, completion rate is a useful metric if you want to see what percentage of people watched the entire story.

(Number of impressions on final post / Number of impressions on first post ) x 100 = Instagram Story completion rate %

So, if 93 people viewed the first post and 59 made it to the end, your Story’s completion rate would be 63%.

## Average.<a name="Average"></a>
Average metrics give you a benchmark for the general performance of your Instagram posts. For example, the metric “average likes per post” tells you generally the number of likes each of your posts received.

Sum of metric for a period (e.g., total likes on posts in January) / Number of posts in that time period = Average

If you shared 12 posts in January and received a total of 715 likes, your average likes per post would be 59.

The common denominator to use is the number of posts (i.e., per post). But you can also use a time period (i.e., per day or per month). For instance, you could calculate the average number of viewers for your Instagram Live videos on different days of the week to determine which day might be best to live stream on Instagram.
